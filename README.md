Introduction

You're at a college party! You're standing in the middle of a sea of people. You're holding a plastic cup of beer. You can hear the laughter and the chatter of people talking and enjoying themselves. You think you may recognize a friend of yours.


The band at the party is playing the song "I Ran" by A Flock of Seagulls. You know this song and you sing along.
This song is about a guy who is still in love with his ex, but he's trying to play it cool at a party. He's trying to convince everyone (and maybe even himself) that it doesn't matter that she left him.

You see a friend of yours. His name is Sam. Sam goes to your college. You think he might be interested in your friend Emily. You think it might be a good idea to introduce Sam to Emily.Emily is wearing a blue and white striped shirt and jeans and her hair is in a ponytail. She's really into science fiction. You think Sam would really like her.
